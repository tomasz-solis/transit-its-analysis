    "# ITS Segmented Regression: Transit Ridership Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Tomasz Solis  \n",
    "**Date:** December 2025  \n",
    "**Learning Goal:** Practice ITS methodology on synthetic data with known ground truth\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I'm Trying to Do\n",
    "\n",
    "Measure the causal impact of express bus lanes launched January 1, 2024 using Interrupted Time Series analysis. Since EDA revealed non-parallel pre-trends across route types, I'm fitting separate models for Downtown, Suburban, and Cross-town routes rather than pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is practice for applying ITS at work (measuring product changes with no control group), so I'm focusing on:\n",
    "1. Getting the technical implementation right\n",
    "2. Understanding where assumptions break down\n",
    "3. Validating against known true effects (advantage of synthetic data)\n",
    "4. Documenting mistakes and learning from them\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Specification (Following The Mixtape Ch. 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each route type separately:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ridership_t = β₀ + β₁(time) + β₂(post_intervention) + β₃(time_since_intervention) + ε_t\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What each parameter means:**\n",
    "- `β₀`: Baseline level (intercept)\n",
    "- `β₁`: Pre-intervention trend (how fast ridership was growing before express lanes)\n",
    "- `β₂`: **Immediate level change** - the jump at intervention (this is what we care about!)\n",
    "- `β₃`: **Slope change** - did growth accelerate/decelerate after intervention?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimation approach:**\n",
    "- OLS regression with Newey-West HAC standard errors (accounts for autocorrelation)\n",
    "- No seasonal controls in this first attempt (will revisit if needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Assumptions I'm Making\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No anticipation** - Ridership didn't change before January 2024 in anticipation of express lanes\n",
    "2. **No other interventions** - Nothing else changed at the same time that would affect ridership\n",
    "3. **Stable underlying process** - The relationship between time and ridership is stable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note:** I'm NOT assuming parallel pre-trends (that was violated in EDA), which is why I'm doing segment-specific models."

    "## 8. What I Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Month Fixed Effects Trap\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mistake I made first:** I initially included month fixed effects (January dummy, February dummy, etc.) to control for seasonality. This seemed logical - transit ridership has seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem:** The intervention happened on January 1, 2024. Every single post-intervention observation in January had BOTH:\n",
    "- `post_intervention = 1` \n",
    "- `month_January = 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "The model couldn't tell whether the jump was from express lanes or just \"January seasonality.\" Result: Month fixed effects absorbed most of the treatment effect. My estimates were only 30% of true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The fix:** Removed month controls for this baseline analysis. When intervention timing coincides with calendar periods, standard seasonal dummies create multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson for real work:**  I'll need to be careful about seasonal adjustment. Options:\n",
    "1. Use Fourier terms (sin/cos) instead of month dummies\n",
    "2. Detrend and deseasonalize before modeling  \n",
    "3. Accept that some seasonal variation can't be separated from treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Worked Well\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Segment-specific models:** Handling non-parallel pre-trends by modeling each route separately was the right call\n",
    "2. **Newey-West SE:** Accounts for autocorrelation without having to explicitly model it\n",
    "3. **Validation:** Having ground truth to check against caught the month FE mistake immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions That Held\n",
    "\n",
    "- No anticipation effects (ridership stable before January 2024)\n",
    "- Clear intervention point (no gradual rollout)\n",
    "- Stable underlying relationship (R² > 0.85 for all routes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations to Acknowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is \"easy mode\" synthetic data - real data will be messier\n",
    "- No concurrent interventions to worry about here\n",
    "- Known treatment effects aren't available with real data\n",
    "- Can't test for spillovers between route types\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Apply to realistic dataset** - smaller effects, more noise, confounders\n",
    "2. **Robustness checks** - placebo tests with fake intervention dates\n",
    "3. **Sensitivity analysis** - how do results change with different specifications?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "ITS can work even with non-parallel pre-trends IF you model segments separately. The bigger challenge will be:\n",
    "1. Distinguishing treatment from concurrent events\n",
    "2. Communicating uncertainty honestly\n",
    "3. Avoiding the seasonal adjustment trap I fell into here\n",
    "\n",
    "Good practice for the real thing."
